## End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline for Node.js CRUD Application

---

## 🏁 Summary

I successfully accomplished an **end-to-end CI/CD pipeline** for a Node.js CRUD application, automating the complete journey from code commit to production deployment. This project reflects real-world DevOps practices, integrating CI, quality gates, containerization, and cloud deployment into a single automated workflow.

---

## 🚀 What I Built

* Configured **GitHub webhooks** to trigger Jenkins automatically on every code push
* Designed and implemented a **Jenkins CI/CD pipeline**
* Integrated **SonarQube** for code quality, security checks, and quality gate enforcement
* Containerized the application using **Docker**
* Pushed Docker images to a **Docker registry**
* Deployed the application to **AWS EC2** as a Docker container
* Achieved **zero manual intervention** from commit to deployment

## 🔄 End-to-End Flow (What Happens on Every Commit)

1. Code is pushed to GitHub
2. GitHub webhook triggers Jenkins
3. Jenkins pulls the latest code
4. Application is built and tested
5. SonarQube analyzes code quality
6. Quality gate validates the build
7. Docker image is built and pushed
8. Latest container is deployed to AWS EC2
