## 🏁 Summary

I successfully accomplished an **end-to-end CI/CD pipeline** for a Node.js CRUD application, automating the complete journey from code commit to production deployment. This project reflects real-world DevOps practices, integrating CI, quality gates, containerization, and cloud deployment into a single automated workflow.
