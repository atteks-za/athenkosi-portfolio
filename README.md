# **Welcome to my portfolio!**


I am a **Cloud & DevSecOps Engineer** passionate about building secure, automated, and scalable cloud solutions. My work spans **Cloud Engineering**, **Cloud Security**, and **DevOps**, with dedicated branches created for each domain to keep the projects organized and easy to explore.

## 🚀 **About Me**

With hands-on experience across IT Systems and Support Administration, Cloud Engineering, and DevSecOps, I design solutions that prioritize:

* Secure and compliant cloud environments
* Automated deployments and CI/CD pipelines
* Resilient, scalable, and cost-efficient architectures
* Continuous monitoring, auditing, and threat detection

Each project demonstrates a combination of security, automation, and cloud-native design principles.

## 🌿 **Portfolio Structure**

To help you navigate my work, I’ve created **separate branches** for each specialization:

* **cloud-engineering** — Infrastructure, serverless apps, networking, automation
* **cloud-security** — Identity & access, threat detection, WAF, encryption, compliance
* **devops** — CI/CD, containerization, IaC, observability, automation pipelines

Each branch contains projects, documentation, and architecture diagrams relevant to that domain.
