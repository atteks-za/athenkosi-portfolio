## **Project: Secure Custom Domain Hosting with Route 53, CloudFront & ACM**

**Summary:**  
Registered a custom domain and connected it to AWS Route 53 by updating the nameservers. Configured a CloudFront distribution to serve an S3-hosted static website. Requested and validated an SSL certificate in ACM using DNS validation, then attached it to CloudFront. Verified successful HTTPS access through the custom domain.

**Key Skills:**  
- Route 53 DNS Management

- HTTPS Configuration  
- S3 Website Delivery
